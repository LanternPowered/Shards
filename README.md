# Shards

A high performance entity component framework (ECS) for Kotlin. It is
licensed under the [MIT License].

The project is currently not stable and shouldn't be used in production. 

The project is build in anticipation for new Kotlin value class features 
which will improve the usability of immutable data and add support for Java 
primitive classes. Optimal performance cannot be expected until these 
features are supported.
